    <h1>About me</h1>
    <p>I am a multi-disciplinary product designer with five years' experience advocating for user and business needs
        across non-profits and government. Every step in my career has been centered on building and measuring impact,
        and I bring that attitude into my design process to create digital products that enable people to live better
        lives.
        I believe that intelligent product design requires making tough trade-offs that de-prioritize bloat and
        complexity in favor of necessary simplicity. In a team, you can count on me to communicate with empathy and
        candor, to design with intention and strategy, and to seek constant improvement.
        I'm excited by how technology can nudge us toward more sustainable systems and can better adapt to the needs of
        non-digital natives. Outside of design work, you'll find me reading books, climbing walls, and making travel
        plans.</p>

    <p>I'm a UX designer passionate about sustainable development and honing my craft. I'm currently at Deloitte Digital, where I've focused on projects from industries such as travel, hospitality and healthcare. Previously, I worked at a design agency supporting website and brand redesigns for small businesses working in logistics and financial services. Before design, I worked in international business and global development, which helped me clarify my career goals and discover how UX practices can increase the effectiveness of development efforts. I studied political science and international studies at Northwestern University, with a focus on global development.</p>
