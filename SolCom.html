        <p>This was a user research project completed in the Dominican Republic. I revisited this project years
            later
            through a UX lens to further iterate on the final design. To skip down to that design process, <a

        <h3>
            Summary
        </h3>
        <p>International NGO Soluciones Comunitarias works to improve the economy and
            health of community members around Latin America. I conducted user research to inform the NGO's first
            in-country
            operations across the Dominican Republic in selling water purifiers/filtration systems. Ultimately, my
            team
            delivered maintenance schedules for water purifiers and final recommendations for which products
            Soluciones
            Comunitarias should launch in the country.</p>

        <h3>Background</h3>
        <p>Soluciones Comunitarias trains and supports local entrepreneurs across Latin America to bring rural
            communities
            access to products that would otherwise be difficult or prohibitively expensive to obtain. My team was
            tasked
            with conducting the research necessary to vet and recommend water filtration/purification system
            products
            appropriate for rural communities across the Dominican Republic. I worked with another researcher to
            identify
            which models would best serve the needs of users in six communities across the country. </p>
        <h3>
            Interviewing and probing in Spanish
        </h3>

        <p>We conducted ethnographic interviews with users in selected communities. We sat in the homes of our
            end-users
            and
            discussed their water access and usage habits.</p>
        <p> In our interviews, we learned that:</p>
        <ul role="list">
            <li>Water filters and purifiers were not available for purchase at local convenience stores, or colmados.
                Purchasing
                one would mean a lengthy trip to a nearby city, where they were prohibitively expensive.</li>
            <li>Users purchased water jugs from colmados or from a water truck that came through the community twice a
                week.
                Nine
                of 28 users we interviewed reported occasional health issues from this water. With the average cost of a
                jug
                between RD$25 - RD$40, users were spending between RD$50 - RD$200 per week on water.</li>
            <li>
                Users were able to purchase water purifying tablets at colmados, but preferred the taste of water coming
                from
                jugs to that of water purified by tablets.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            These insights validated that there was a need for alternative water purification/filtration options. As
            a
            result, we turned our attention to comparing product options.
        </p>
        <h3>
            Testing, product analyses, and lots of poor-tasting agua
        </h3>
        <p>
            There were a few constraints that we took into our product analyses. The water purification/filtration
            systems
            had to operate without electricity, because many users had either unstable or no access to electricity.
            They
            had
            to be portable so that one person could carry it home after purchase from a community campaign, and they
            had
            be
            capable of functioning in the hot temperatures and high humidity of the Caribbean.
        </p>
        <p>
            With that knowledge, we evaluated six options, including individual-use products, whole-household
            products,
            and
            even DIY-options like <a
                href="https://www.cdc.gov/healthywater/global/household-water-treatment/solardisinfection.html?CDC_AA_refVal=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.cdc.gov%2Fsafewater%2Fsolardisinfection.html">SODIS</a>.
            We also evaluated the "control" option of end-users sticking to their current methods for sourcing
            water.
        </p>
        <p>
            In weighing the findings from this research, my teammate and I concluded that the ability to purify and
            store
            water in the system itself was of critical importance. This was for two reasons: users required a high
            volume of
            water each week, and they needed access to large amounts of water on-demand (rather than waiting for it
            to
            drip
            through the filter before they could use it). This criterion led us to narrow down two options: the ILAC
            Purifier and FilterPure.
        </p>

                into
                the second by means of a purifing stone.</figcaption>
        </figure>

            <div class="img_container_filterpure">

            </div>
            <figcaption>The FilterPure water filter consists of one bucket, with a porous and thick clay basin sitting
                inside the rim. Dirty water pools in the clay basin before passing through the clay to collect below in
                the
                base of the bucket.</figcaption>
        </figure>
        <h3>Enabling ease of use </h3>
        <p>The key issue with both of these products was the complicated maintenance they required. Each product
            came
            with a
            separate paper booklet with cleaning instructions, outlining different steps to complete at different
            points
            in
            time (weekly, monthly, etc.) We decided that a well-designed maintenance schedule would be key to
            ensuring
            that
            end-users benefited from using the filters regularly and safely.</p>
        <p>
            We decided to prioritize three items in the design:
        </p>
        <ul role="list">
            <li>Making the guides easier to follow by organizing each maintenance task by the timeline it requires â€”
                daily,
                weekly, etc.</li>
            <li>Changing the format of the guides from paper to stickers that adhere directly to the product, since
                paper
                can
                get wet, torn, lost, etc.</li>
            <li>
                Making it easy to record completion of each step using a marker that will wipe off the adhesive sticker
                each
                time a round of cleaning is required.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            We settled on a monthly calendar that allowed users to mark completion of certain activities.</p>
        <img class="solcom-images" src="Images/First Calendar.png"
            alt="Monthly calendar with details of which instructions to follow at certain points in the month">
        <p>The complex nature of the steps prevented us from being able to completely eliminate the paper guide.
            However,
            we did re-design guides for both products, with a focus on improving clarity and cultural
            appropriateness.</p>

            Implementation and Impact
        </h3>
        <p>This project allowed Soluciones Comunitarias to immediately provide their entrepreneurs with vetted
            purifiers
            for
            sale. In doing so, this project facilitated the sale of 13 purifiers. The timeline of this project did
            not
            allow
            us to conduct additional testing with users who had purchased these
            products, so that served as a final recommendation for a future scope of work. If I had the opportunity
            to
            continue the project further, I would like to conduct ethnographic research in users' homes, observing
            their
            usage and maintenance patterns. Interview questions might focus on changes in users' lifestyle,
            purchases,
            health and vitality, and social patterns since purchasing a filter.
        </p>
        <h3 id="Independent Follow-up">
            Independent Follow-up
        </h3>
        <p>
            Following the conclusion of this project, I decided to revisit it independently to explore ways that the
            maintenance information for these water filtration/purification systems might be better designed, given
            that
            filling in the dates each month required a lot from users. From my previous design, I wanted to keep the
            information physically attached the product (i.e. a sticker on the side). However, I wanted to improve
            the
            design in two key areas. First, it needed to serve as a quick reference for users during the entire
            five-year
            lifecycle of their filter. Second, the design needed to tell users when the filter needed to be replaced
            (after
            five years of use).
        </p>
        <p>
            I began by sketching out alternative options of displaying the information across time.
        </p>
        <div class="sketch-grid">
            <img class="sketch1" src="Images/Yearly Calendar Sketch.jpeg"
                alt="Sketch of an annual maintenance calendar">
            <img class="sketch2" src="Images/Weekly Calendar Sketch.jpeg" alt="Sketch of a weekly maintenance calendar">
        </div>
        <p>
            This design was complex for two reasons: First, the information would need to adapt to dates across
            several
            years, where dates fall on different days of the week each year. Thus, a standard calendar showing the
            dates
            in
            each month in a weekly format would not work. Second, the information would be displayed statically on a
            printed
            sticker, rather than on a changeable digital interface. Therefore, users wouldn't be able to alter the
            design
            beyond scribbling over it with a marker. I needed to design the information architecture in such a way
            that
            it
            didn't conflict with a user's mental model of a calendar despite not looking like most calendars.
        </p>
        <p>
            Because maintenance work was required bi-weekly, I reasoned that an annual calendar format where weeks
            had
            prominence over months was the most appropriate structure. Because the filters were meant to be used for
            up
            to
            five years, I also included a space for users to record the date of purchase for their product. Because
            both
            products were manufactured domestically, I included the local number for users to reach the manufacturer
            in
            case
            of a problem. My plan was to highlight the dates in which the maintenance would be required, spaced out
            in
            bi-weekly increments.
        </p>
        <img class="solcom-images" src="Images/Annual Calendar.png"
            alt="Diagram of an annual calendar in which user can track maintenance of their water filter in bi-weekly increments throughout the year.">
        <p>
            This posed a serious issue though: users could purchase a water filtration/purification system on any
            date!
            Furthermore, there was likely a gap of a few days between when users purchased the product and when they
            began
            using it. For those reasons, users needed a way to set their own start date for their maintenance
            schedule,
            without having to painstakingly fill in an entire year's worth of dates.
        </p>
        <p>
            I re-examined what the user really needed through this designâ€”and it wasn't tracking specific dates in a
            month
            or week. Rather, it was a way to track the time from each filter cleaning. As a result, I settled on a
            simple
            design that allowed users to track their maintenance schedule according to days of the weekâ€”a standard
            of
            time
            that is constant over months and years.
        </p>

        <p>
            I really enjoyed working through the unique constraints and challenges this project presented, and
            applying
            my
            UX research and design skills to a non-digital medium. To learn more about my process, feel free to
