                Summary
            </h3>
            <p>During a pandemic forcing physical isolation, how might we reduce feelings of emotional isolation for the
                elderly? In a time when we can't walk through another's front door, how might we might we bring support
                to the "doorstep" of those who need it? For an exercise in quick decision-making, ideating, and
                prototyping, I worked with two other designers to explore this problem over one weekend in a 48-hour
                design-a-thon. Our final product, UpLift, connects volunteers with elderly beneficiaries needing help
                completing errands or tasks.

            <h3>Friday evening: Identifying the problem</h3>
            <p>To kick off our work, my team brainstormed around COVID-19's effects and implications on various
                demographic groups in the United States. We explored the psychological and emotional challenges the
                virus brings (including the extra danger brought to at-risk individuals), as well as its effects on
                childcare, education, employment, medical staff and essential workers.</p>

                alt="image of post-it notes on a virtual board with how might we statements written on them, and dot votes added.">
            <p>FA "How Might We (HMW)" exercise followed by dot-voting helped us scope down to two demographic areas:
                the isolated elderly (those not living in a long-term care facility), and non-essential workers looking
                to contribute their skills. The following "HMW" question served as a guide:</p>
            <p>How might we help individuals contribute their skills to the otherwise-independent elderly experiencing
                isolation and loneliness?</p>
            <h3>Saturday Morning: Market Research</h3>
            <p>What options currently exist for the connecting these two groups of people? We took a few hours to find
                out. We explored both digital and non-digital options and evaluated them based on the amount of effort
                they required from elderly beneficiaries and their potential for scalability across circumstances.
                Rather than considering these metrics from a business perspective, we used them to help guide us to a
                solution that, if developed, could help the most people. </p>
            <p>Our product needed to be sensitive to the needs of elderly beneficiaries while also proving useful for as
                many skilled volunteers as possible.</p>
            <p>Our findings revealed a potential market opportunity for a product that required low effort from
                beneficiaries and tapped into the "supply pipeline" of skilled volunteers looking to help.</p>

            <h3>Saturday afternoon: Identifying assumptions and clarifying the problem</h3>
            <p>We acknowledged that our work thus far rested on a few assumptions, the most key being:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Skilled individuals not employed as essential workers have time to help.</li>
                <li>Individuals want to contribute but don't know how to find recipients.</li>
                <li>Human interaction is a basic human need essential to staying well.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>With the tight time restrictions we were under, we weren't able to conduct robust research with users
                other than brief interviews within our social circles. However, those conversations, paired with
                knowledge of the options evaluated above, showed that there was an appetite for connection on the part
                of both skilled volunteers and elderly beneficiaries and led us to a problem statement: Individuals
                looking for ways to support isolated seniors need a way to know where and how they can use their skills
                to help.</p>
            <h3>Saturday Evening: Sketching and Storyboarding</h3>
            <p>Given that we were crafting a volunteer-based service, we wanted to ensure that both the volunteer's
                experience and the beneficiary's experience received attention. To do so, we sketched a storyboard that
                incorporated a user flow for each person, and the UpLift product began to take shape as a service where
                beneficiaries could text in a request for assistance, and helpers would accept the task, complete a
                safety check, and provide the assistance requested.</p>
            <p>In keeping with the opportunity space we identified, we wanted the product to be as straightforward as
                possible for beneficiaries to use. Beneficiaries with a cell phone are more familiar with its native
                functionality than they would be with a new app or interface—therefore, beneficiaries can interact with
                UpLift via text message.</p>

            <h3>Sunday morning: prototyping</h3>
            <p>In order to establish an MVP version of UpLift, we crafted a basic set of wireframes to detail the
                interface helpers would see.</p>
                <iframe class="responsive-iframe-mobile" src="https://www.figma.com/embed?embed_host=share&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.figma.com%2Fproto%2FDpXPglHepjP9TflgLrsRNH%2FCOVID-19-Designathon%253A-UpLift-Wireframes%3Fnode-id%3D0%253A2%26starting-point-node-id%3D0%253A2" allowfullscreen></iframe>"
            <h3>Sunday Afternoon: Reflecting on Gaps</h3>
            <p>This fast-paced product design exercise was an excellent experience, but it also came with the caveat of
                knowing that a product like UpLift would need to address a multitude of questions to reach development
                and provide value. For starters, designing fail and empty states throughout the app is a necessary
                precursor to conducting concept and usability tests. Areas to research further in these tests include
                UpLift's use of the word "tasks" (may be construed as transactional), as well as privacy and vetting
                concerns.</p>
            <p>For V2 or later, attention might be paid as to how users might submit a request on behalf of a
                beneficiary that might not be willing or able to request one themselves.</p>
            <p>I had a great experience with this design exercise. I'm always looking for similar opportunities to
                refine my skills—if you have a suggestion or question, please contact me.</p>
