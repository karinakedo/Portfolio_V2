    <h1>
        Kilimanjaro Porters Assistance Project
    </h1>
    <h2>
        promoting responsible travel and ethical tourism on mount kilimanjaro
    </h2>
    <p>This was a user research project completed in the Dominican Republic. I revisited this project years
        later
        through a UX lens to further iterate on the final design.
    </p>

    <h3>
        Summary
    </h3>
    <p>The Kilimanjaro Porters Assistance Project (KPAP) is a Tanzanian NGO focused on securing ethical treatment and
        fair pay for the porters on Mount Kilimanjaro. I worked with KPAP staff and volunteers to improve the usability
        and visual design of their website.</p>

    <h3>The Problem</h3>
    <p>KPAP offers supports Kilimanjaro porters through free gear rentals and educational and training opportunities.
        They also promote ethical mountain climbs through their Partner for Responsible Travel program. As a small
        non-profit based at the foot of Kilimanjaro, KPAP needed a website that effectively communicated their work and
        accomplished two key goals:</p>
    <ul role="list">
        <li>Persuading visiting climbers to book with a KPAP-approved Partner for Responsible Travel</li>
        <li>Convincing tourism companies to commit to ethical practices and become a Partner for Responsible Travel</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        The onset of the COVID-19 pandemic deeply impacted the global tourism industry, which made communicating KPAP's
        work effectively online more crucial than ever. As a first step, I planned out a project scope that would have
        me looking at the site content
        and page structure across the site as well as making improvements to the UI.
    </p>
    <h3>
        Establishing Priorities
    </h3>
    <p>I met with the KPAP team in Tanzania and Scotland via Zoom to identify the technical constraints that would
        define my work. As KPAP is a small organization that relies heavily on volunteering, all designs needed to be
        easy to manage and update, and had to minimize complexity and render quickly on slow internet connections.</p>
    <p>After asking tons of questions, I settled on a few directives to serve as my personal design principles:</p>
    <ul role="list">
        <li>Lean and Fast: don't introduce complication or complexity unless absolutely necessary (a tenet I try to
            apply in every project!)</li>
        <li>More than the Mountain: show the human side of Kilimanjaro (the porters!) as much as possible</li>
        <li>Stellar Documentation: record the context and reasoning behind design decisions to ensure clarity far into
            the future</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>
        Determining Navigation Structure
    </h3>
    <p>
        When I analyzed behavior patterns on the existing site, I learned that most users were bouncing between
        unrelated pages before settling on the "Porter Treatment Guidelines and Tipping Recommendations" page or the
        "Becoming a Partner" page. It was clear that the information architecture on the existing KPAP site needed to be
        reconsidered in order to allow easier navigation to this key content.
    </p>
    <p>Before anything else, I needed to rework the information architecture to match the needs of users visiting the
        site. </p>
    <h3>Tree Test Setup and Results</h3>
    <p>The site content needed to be structured in such a way as to create channels for the various users visiting the
        site: aspiring Kilimanjaro climbers, tourism companies, potential donors, and those looking to learn about KPAP.
        I examined the content of each page and created a new menu structure to test with users in a tree test.
    </p>
    <p>Because access to users and time was limited, I opted for a tree test instead of a card sort and arranged the
        content in a way that created "channels" for each group of users from the top-level nav, such as "For Climbers"
        and "For Tourism Companies".</p>
    <p>
        20 users completed the tree test, and results confirmed that the proposed menu structure would enable aspiring
        climbers and tourism companies to find information relevant to them. The results also revealed that potential
        donors would look in three spots to learn about KPAP's cause: About Us, Donate, and Contact Us.
    </p>
    <p>The site needed a message "selling" the impact of a donation in these three spots. While creating new copy was
        outside the project scope, I took note of this finding to incorporate it in future.</p>
    <h3>Putting the Content to Work</h3>
    <p>Now that the menu structure was in place, I needed to re-organize the existing content to match each page's
        purpose. I conducted an audit of the existing copy to determine the message and function of each section and
        assigned it to a group.</p>
    <p>I re-worked the content with a focus on brevity, clarity, and intentional language choice.</p>
    <h3>Designing for Visual Impact</h3>
    <p>KPAP had access to compelling, professionally-captured photographs, so I made sure to leave room for the eye to
        take in those visuals.</p>
    <h3>Establishing the UI</h3>
    <p>I made a number of improvements that instantly made for a more cohesive UI, including a simple favicon that
        matched the site (and the shape of Kilimanjaro!), a set of updated social media icons, and a color and text
        style guide.</p>
    <p>I wanted the primary color to be bright and professional, so I eyedropped from a photo that I wanted to take
        center
        stage, and used that color for CTAs.</p>
    <h3>The Result</h3>
    <p>For my first scope of work, I delivered a re-designed website with clear information hierarchy, content
        structure, and improved visuals.</p>
