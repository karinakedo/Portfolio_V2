                Modernizing Booking Experience on Hotel Website
            </h1>
            <h2>
                Redesigning the search results page of a hospitality company
            </h2>

            <h3>
                Summary
            </h3>
            <p>An international hotel company was looking to modernize and enhance their web search and booking
                experience while simultaneously migrating to Adobe Experience Manager. As the lead UX designer embedded
                on the client-side search team, I was responsible for providing recommendations on UX enhancements
                across global domains and for delivering new designs for key steps in the search and hotel selection
                experience. Within this role, I spent nine months working closely with product, development, and the
                wider company’s design team to improve the existing experience and craft a new web search results page.
            </p>

            <h3>Background</h3>
            <p>As a major player in the travel and hospitality space, this company was eager to smooth friction points
                in their online booking experience and capitalize on the resurgence of travel following COVID-19
                lockdowns. Our team was responsible for the search portion of the booking path, encompassing search
                results, map, and "quick views" of each result. The current experience had a number of bugs,
                inconsistencies, and limitations that lengthened the booking process and hurt conversion rates. After
                spending three months addressing these issues with a focus on the mobile web experience, our team
                shifted our attention toward an overhaul of these steps in the booking path.</p>

            <h3>Initial Steps</h3>
            <p>The initial ask for this work was to provide a north star view of a future search results page. Our team
                looked at best-in-class examples from the travel, hospitality, and retail industries, and I identified
                examples of design decisions that could improve the experience on the site. For example, could we
                capitalize on the professional photography assets at our fingertips and have photos of each hotel play a
                larger role in the search results?</p>
            <iframe class="responsive-iframe-mobile"
                src="https://www.figma.com/embed?embed_host=share&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.figma.com%2Fproto%2FsEyWWYoNIQgpGKyrKKk6zz%2FHotel-Company-Mockups-for-Portfolio%3Fpage-id%3D57%253A2178%26node-id%3D57%253A2181%26viewport%3D414%252C333%252C0.15%26scaling%3Dscale-down%26starting-point-node-id%3D57%253A2181"
                allowfullscreen></iframe>
            <p>Could we hide second-level information about each hotel (and display it when a user hovers) in order to
                reduce visual clutter on the search result cards on desktop?</p>
            <iframe class="responsive-iframe-desktop"
                src="https://www.figma.com/embed?embed_host=share&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.figma.com%2Fproto%2FsEyWWYoNIQgpGKyrKKk6zz%2FHotel-Company-Mockups-for-Portfolio%3Fpage-id%3D57%253A2179%26node-id%3D57%253A2897%26viewport%3D379%252C317%252C0.06%26scaling%3Dscale-down%26starting-point-node-id%3D57%253A2897"
                allowfullscreen></iframe>
            <p>I also conducted a competitive analysis of all of the features present on the search results pages of 25
                key competitors. That analysis resulted in over 90 features, many of which were beyond the capacity of
                the current tech stack.</p>
            <p>In sorting through my findings with the team, it became clear that we needed to scope down to an MVP. We
                defined new constraints, detailing that we’d migrate to Adobe Experience Manager with only existing
                content and technical capabilities. The plan was to ship an MVP version of the search page for a limited
                percentage of users, collect KPI data, and iterate accordingly. In doing so, we wanted to make sure that
                we improved conversion rates (especially on mobile web, which sat at 6%), and that we provided an
                experience that better matched how users expected to search and narrow down hotel options. From a design
                perspective, we decided to focus on three key areas:
            <ul>
                <li>Page layout: where should everything sit on the page, and how much space should be given to a map,
                    versus filter and sort controls, versus hotel cards. The current experience offered sub-optimal
                    views of each of these elements, so we wanted to ensure the future page layout reflected user search
                    patterns.</li>

                            alt="Mock up of the page layout of the client's existing search results page. The map view of the hotel search results takes up nearly two-thirds of the screen.

                        <figcaption class="filtering_caption">Mock up of the filtering and sorting modal of the client's

                            would cover the whole screen. Confusingly, he sorting options include three categories for
                            sorting by location: city, state, and distance.</figcaption>

                            alt="Mock up of the hotel cards of the client's existing search results page.">

                            search results page. There was a lack of consistency in interactive text: colors indicate

                    </figure>
                </div>

                <li>Filtering: the current experience required users to open a modal in order to interact with filters.
                    Visually separated from the search results, this experience required users to hunt for each filter
                    they wanted—and filters were organized in categories that didn’t match a user’s mental model.</li>


                <li>Hotel cards: the cards included links that took users off the booking path, used four different
                    colors to indicate interactivity, and included unnecessary pieces of information that routinely
                    confused users.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Narrowing in on these three categories gave our team a blueprint for building out product hypotheses and
                research plans.</p>
            </p>
            <h3>Research Approach</h3>
            <p>In the years preceding my team’s work, the company had amassed a collection of designs, prototypes, and
                various research findings related to the search results page. I sorted through these assets and grouped
                each piece of information according to the three areas of focus we identified, and tagged it as either a
                known, an assumption, or a knowledge gap. I used these groupings to guide the questions I asked key
                stakeholders and users. Because the company's global customer base was so large, I established a set of
                parameters around an individual's travel habits, demographic information and hotel memberships to
                identify research participants. </p>
            <p>A key consideration that guided my thinking was understanding how users expected to search for hotels.
                Did they look at hotels on a map first, or opt to filter first? For the hotel cards, I wanted to
                understand the relative importance of each piece of information about a hotel in the decision-making
                process. We knew that location and price were the two most important considerations, followed by guest
                rating. However, where should everything else fall? To find out, our team conducted card sorts with
                sample hotel information and analyzed click tracking data. I conducted 20 user interviews and 60
                usability tests, where I had users search for different types of hotels in different destinations
                (cities, islands) and observed what elements of the page the interacted with, and in what order.
            </p>
            <p>I sorted my research findings according to their origin (qualitative or quantitative data, behavioral or
                attitudinal) and connected each insight to a corresponding product hypothesis. Cross-team conversations
                with SME stakeholders helped provide a point of view on the strength of each hypothesis, and the
                company’s appetite and bandwidth for testing. </p>
            <h3>
                Design Approach
            </h3>
            <p>I matched the fidelity of my designs to the fidelity or maturity of the decision-making process we were
                in at the time. When we were determining the overall layout of the page, I created low fidelity
                wireframes and thought through potential interaction patterns between main elements. When we were
                determining content hierarchy and placement, mid-fidelity wireframes with detailed states helped keep us
                more focused on the content than the final visuals. I cycled between rounds of feedback from design,
                product, and development at each stage and documented what was removed from MVP scope.
            </p>
            <p>As I moved through design options for each of these elements, I was challenged by balancing the needs of
                the existing user base with the desire to modernize the e-commerce experience to achieve parity with
                other leading travel brands. The majority of users were long-time, loyal customers who were accustomed
                to the existing experience, which, for better or worse, mirrored that of most hotel companies. There was
                a sharp difference between these websites and the more robust experiences offered by online travel
                agencies (OTAs) such as Expedia or Booking.com. Our team struggled with where we should land between
                these two groups. As I explored options, I ruled out designs that deviated too far from industry
                standards. For example, in the page layout, I considered a design that showed a smaller map and full
                width-carousels of each search result. The idea was to keep key information (such as hotel name and
                price) sticky, while showcasing more photos from each hotel. Ultimately, we needed to follow industry
                conventions that we saw across a dozen+ competitors, and keep the search results looking like a
                stand-alone card.</p>
            <h3>
                Results
            </h3>
            <p>Although I was not able to support this project through go-live of the new experience, serving as the UX
                lead through concepting, research, strategy, and design iterations was a fantastic learning experience.
                As my first e-commerce project, this work challenged me to consider the downstream effects of design
                decisions across a complex booking path and to manage competing priorities from client-side
                stakeholders.</p>
