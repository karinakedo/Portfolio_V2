        <h2>
            promoting responsible travel and ethical tourism on mount kilimanjaro
        </h2>
        <h3>
            Summary
        </h3>
        <p>The Kilimanjaro Porters Assistance Project (KPAP) is a Tanzanian NGO focused on securing ethical treatment
            and
            fair pay for the porters on Mount Kilimanjaro. I worked with KPAP staff and volunteers to improve the
            usability
            and visual design of their website.</p>

        <h3>The Problem</h3>
        <p>KPAP offers supports Kilimanjaro porters through free gear rentals and educational and training
            opportunities.
            They also promote ethical mountain climbs through their Partner for Responsible Travel program. As a small
            non-profit based at the foot of Kilimanjaro, KPAP needed a website that effectively communicated their work
            and
            accomplished two key goals:</p>
        <ul role="list">
            <li>Persuading visiting climbers to book with a KPAP-approved Partner for Responsible Travel</li>
            <li>Convincing tourism companies to commit to ethical practices and become a Partner for Responsible Travel
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            The onset of the COVID-19 pandemic deeply impacted the global tourism industry, which made communicating
            KPAP's
            work effectively online more crucial than ever. As a first step, I planned out a project scope that would
            have
            me looking at the site content
            and page structure across the site as well as making improvements to the UI.
        </p>
        <h3>
            Establishing Priorities
        </h3>
        <p>I met with the KPAP team in Tanzania and Scotland via Zoom to identify the technical constraints that would
            define my work. As KPAP is a small organization that relies heavily on volunteering, all designs needed to
            be
            easy to manage and update, and had to minimize complexity and render quickly on slow internet connections.
        </p>
        <p>After asking tons of questions, I settled on a few directives to serve as my personal design principles:</p>
        <ul role="list">
            <li>Lean and Fast: don't introduce complication or complexity unless absolutely necessary (a tenet I try to
                apply in every project!)</li>
            <li>More than the Mountain: show the human side of Kilimanjaro (the porters!) as much as possible</li>
            <li>Stellar Documentation: record the context and reasoning behind design decisions to ensure clarity far
                into
                the future</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>
            Determining Navigation Structure
        </h3>
        <p>
            When I analyzed behavior patterns on the existing site, I learned that most users were bouncing between
            unrelated pages before settling on the "Porter Treatment Guidelines and Tipping Recommendations" page or the
            "Becoming a Partner" page. It was clear that the information architecture on the existing KPAP site needed
            to be
            reconsidered in order to allow easier navigation to this key content.
        </p>
        <p>Before anything else, I needed to rework the information architecture to match the needs of users visiting
            the
            site. </p>

            <figcaption>Screenshot of existing KPAP Get Involved page showing page structure</figcaption>
        </figure>

        <h3>Tree Test Setup and Results</h3>
        <p>The site content needed to be structured in such a way as to create channels for the various users visiting
            the
            site: aspiring Kilimanjaro climbers, tourism companies, potential donors, and those looking to learn about
            KPAP.
            I examined the content of each page and created a new menu structure to test with users in a tree test.
        </p>
        <p>Because access to users and time was limited, I opted for a tree test instead of a card sort and arranged the
            content in a way that created "channels" for each group of users from the top-level nav, such as "For
            Climbers"
            and "For Tourism Companies".</p>

        <div class="grid_tree_test">
            <figure class="before">
                <img class="kpap_sample_menu_structure_tree_test" src="Images/KPAP_sample_menu_structure_tree_test.png"
                    alt="Sample menu structure from tree test. The About Us section includes Our Impact and In the Media pages. The For Climbers section includes Climb with a Responsible Travel Company, Porter Treatment and Tipping Guidelines, and Share Information from your Climb. The For Tourism Companies section includes Why Partner with Us and Register as a Partner for Responsible Travel. The Donate section includes Supporting Kilimanjaro Porters during COVID-19 and Thanks to Our Donors. The Contact Us section includes one page, titled Email List Sign Up.">
                <figcaption class="kpap_sample_menu_structure_tree_test_caption">Sample menu structure from tree test
                </figcaption>
            </figure>
            <figure class="after">
                <img class="KPAP_sample_task_from_tree_test" src="Images/KPAP_sample_task_from_tree_test.png"
                    alt="Sample task from tree test. This task reads, You are interested in climbing Mount Kilimanjaro, but want to use a reputable tour company. Where would you look to find one?">

            </figure>
        </div>

        <p>
            20 users completed the tree test, and results confirmed that the proposed menu structure would enable
            aspiring
            climbers and tourism companies to find information relevant to them. The results also revealed that
            potential
            donors would look in three spots to learn about KPAP's cause: About Us, Donate, and Contact Us.
        </p>
        <figure>
            <img class="kpap_images" src="Images/KPAP_tree_test_results.png"
                alt="Tree test results for a task regarding donating to KPAP. Most users initially visited the About Us, Donate, and Contact Us sections. Those who navigated to Contact Us went back.">
            <figcaption>Tree test results for a task regarding donating to KPAP. Most users initially visited the About
                Us,
                Donate, and Contact Us sections. Those who navigated to Contact Us went back.</figcaption>
        </figure>

        <p>The site needed a message "selling" the impact of a donation in these three spots. While creating new copy
            was
            outside the project scope, I took note of this finding to incorporate it in future.</p>
        <h3>Putting the Content to Work</h3>
        <p>Now that the menu structure was in place, I needed to re-organize the existing content to match each page's
            purpose. I conducted an audit of the existing copy to determine the message and function of each section and
            assigned it to a group.</p>
        <p>I re-worked the content with a focus on brevity, clarity, and intentional language choice.</p>
        <div class="grid_before_after">
            <figure class="before">
                <h4>Before:</h4>
                <p>Existing copy explaining KPAP's impact was originally quite text-heavy, with bolded text serving as
                    the
                    only
                    means of hierarchy.</p>
                <img class="kpap_images_beforeafter" src="Images/KPAP_old_impact_page.png"
                    alt="Screenshot of old KPAP Impact page. The page is text-heavy and difficult to read.">
                <figcaption>Screenshot of old KPAP Impact page</figcaption>
            </figure>
            <figure class="after">
                <h4>After:</h4>
                <p>I used meaningful iconography and hierarchy to make the message scannable. I also used language that
                    would
                    suit a
                    global audience.</p>

                    alt="Screenshot of new KPAP Our Impact page with text separated into sections and icons added.">

            </figure>
        </div>
        <h3>Establishing Visual Cohesion</h3>
        <p>I made changes that instantly added cohesion to the design and made stronger use of the professional
            photographs
            KPAP had on hand.</p>
        <p>I eyedropped from a photo that I wanted to take
            center
            stage, and built the style guide around that color.</p>

            alt="Image of style guide assets, including typography, color, buttons and image treatment">

        <h3>The Result</h3>
        <p>At the conclusion of this project, I delivered a re-designed website with clear information hierarchy,
            content
            structure, and improved visuals.</p>

            Ethical tourism on Kilimanjaro is vital to maintaining the natural beauty of the mountain and the well-being
            of the community surrounding it. If you're considering a climb, consult KPAP's list of approved <a href="https://kiliporters.org/climb-with-a-partner-for-responsible-travel-company/">Partners for
            Responsible Travel</a>. Asante Sana!
